This notebook follows the steps in https://happygitwithr.com/

We start the notebook when we get to this point: https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html and generate a token...

```{r generate token}
#this just opens your browser at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
usethis::create_github_token()
```

## Use `gitcreds`

We use the `gitcreds` package to prompt us to enter the PAT (Personal Access Token).

This needs to be entered in the console below when prompted.


```{r activate gitcreds}
#install.packages("gitcreds")
#library(gitcreds)
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```
